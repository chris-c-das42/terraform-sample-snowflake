# .terraform folder is where all provider and modules depenencies are downloaded.
#   There is nothing important in this folder and it is safe to delete if needed:

# do NOT delete state files
#      This is how Terraform knows the state of the resources it is managing.
#       Delete this, and Terraform doesn't know what to manage anymore.
